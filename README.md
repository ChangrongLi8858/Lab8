## Short paragraph about graceful degradation and service workers:
- Graceful degradation and service workers are related in their approach to maintaining core functionality under suboptimal conditions. While graceful degradation ensures that an application remains usable without advanced features, service workers support this by enabling offline access, caching, and fallback strategies, thereby preserving essential user experiences when network or script support is limited.
